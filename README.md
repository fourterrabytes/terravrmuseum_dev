TERRAVR MUSEUM - A template Unreal 5 VR museum project.

TerraVR Museum is a model VR museum exhibit project made in Unreal Engine 5, primarily for digital works with flexibility with how the artist wants to present their work. 

Features:
- Drag and drop style interface for 2D and 3D exhibit pieces.
- Customizeable flourishes like podiums and picture frames.
- Standard and IES lighting in easy to use blueprints.
- Comes with a feature/test room, and a showcase exhibit about ancient Egyptian art.

Running This Project

Requires Unreal Engine 5.4.4 (most of the code should work on older or newer versions of Unreal Engine 5, but I have not tested them.
